gl4
===

GL4 (Game Library Mark IV) contains a microkernel game engine and a library of
functions for ultra-rapid game prototyping. All code is client-side Javascript
targeting HTML5/Canvas.

The library is an experiment in applying two concepts to game development:
declarative programming and pervasive use of tagging. So far this has got me
games with insanely short code and frighteningly robust mechanics, at the price
of unusual syntax and opaque workings.

Because this is a piece of mad science, there are no guarantees about
stability, usability, existence and/or accuracy of documentation, or
compatibility with any browser older than a few months or made by Microsoft. I
do care about those guarantees, but the focus of this repository is
experimentation.
