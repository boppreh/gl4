Fixes
=====

! Update size after rotating
- Make tests
- Eager image prefetching in 'Create' behavior
- Preload sounds
- Add more keys to 'isPressed'
- Cache effects and images drawn for faster rendering


New Features
============

! Add object destruction
+ Add object/area collision (or Area objects?)
+ Add object/object collision with pixel checking
+ Add resource system
- Use frame-invariable physics steps (RK4?)
- Add object/object collision with circles
- Use multiple layers to draw (allows Z coordinates and UI/Game separation)
? Use multiple collision types in a single check (circle/AABB, AABB/pixel)


System suggestions
==================

! Use OOP for creating Behaviors
! Allow objects found by conditionals to be used by behaviors
+ Remove 'tags' from 'register' and use 'bind' function
+ Include effects support
+ Include animation support
- Split conditionals into 'On' function and test
~ Include online multiplayer support
? Include tile support (different types of layers?)
? Allow multiple GL4 objects (which one will the behaviors use?)


New Behaviors
=============

+ Damage
- Delay
- Sight
~ Keyboard control (angular and not)
~ Show health
? Tag/Untag (or use GL4 function only?)


New Conditions
==============

! Mouse Down/Up/Move/Over
+ Up/Down (key)
+ Pulse
+ Time
+ Destruction
- Crossing
- Distance
- Movement
~ Key (pressed) (use Key Up or smooth out Key Down?)
~ Creation
~ Operators (not, and, or)
? Test
? Exists (run over single item?)


New Effects
===========

+ Fade In/Out
+ Resize
+ Spin
+ Tint/Untint


Utils
=====

+ Random in/on circle/rectangle
- On line/grid


Review
======

- Randomization system 'r'
- Wrap/Reflect duplicated code
- Split file (core/kernel, behaviors, conditions)
- Module/OOP decision
